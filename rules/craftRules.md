# Explicit Crafting Rules

### Time to Craft

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time required to craft an item depends on the complexity of the item, special matierials, or the level of spell required to make the item.

##### Base Craft Time*
| Item Rarity | Work Weeks (10 days/week) |
|:----:|:-------------:|
| Common  | 1 |
| Uncommon  | 5 |
| Rare | 50 |
| Very Rare | 100 |
| Legendary | 500 |
*This time is halved if the item created is consumable. (scroll, potion, oil, grenade...)

> This table assumes the Player is working a minimum of 4 hours a day.  If they are instead working 8 hours a day reduce the crafting time by half.

### The Craft Roll

A character must be proficient with the required tools for the task, this gives them a proficiency bonus on their crafting rolls

In order to craft a magical item, the crafter must know the spell needed to infuse the item with magic

Crafting stat (STR, DEX, CHA, INT, WIS, CON) will be determined by the DM to most closely fit the type of crafting being performed. 

Example: weaving = D20 + DEX + proficiency bonus + 5 (if using magic loom)
Example: potion crafting = D20 + INT + proficiency bonus
Example: Blacksmithing = D20 + STR + proficiency bonus

##### Craft Roll
| Roll Result | Time Reduction |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 10  | -1 day |
| 15  | -2 days |
| 20 | -3 Days |
| 25 | -4 Days |
| 30 | -5 Days |
|etc...| etc...|
